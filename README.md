## 👨🏻‍⚕️ Project 1 CLI Spa Wokers and Customers Schedualing 
In our dental clinic, there are 3 dental chairs, 3 seats for patients, and a waiting area. In the waiting area, there is a sofa for 4 people to sit on while the other patients stand. There can be no more than N patients in the clinic at any given time, including those in treatment and those waiting. No one is allowed to enter the clinic if there are already N patients present. Inside, a patient sits in a treatment chair or on the sofa or stands if the sofa is occupied. When one of the dental chairs becomes available, the patient who has been waiting on the sofa for the longest time approaches it for treatment. If there are standing patients at that moment, the one who has been waiting the longest time sits on the sofa. When a patient's treatment is finished, the dental assistant can accept payment from them. However, due to the fact that there is only one cash register, payment can only be made for one patient at a time. The dental chairs divide their time between treating patients, accepting payment, and resting in their chairs while waiting for patients.
